Mobile Analytics Frameworks and Libraries

### [GoogleAnalytics-iOS-SDK](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ios/)
Google Analytics SDK for iOS makes it easy for native iOS developers to collect user engagement data form their applications. Developers can then use the Google Analytics reports to measure:

* The number of active users are using their applications.
* From where in the world the application is being used.
* Adoption and usage of specific features.
* In-app purchases and transactions.
* Crashes and exceptions.
* And many other useful metrics...
